- en: Infinite scrolling is a technique employed by a lot of popular sites that minimizes
    the amount of data loaded on a page initially, and then incrementally loads more
    data when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page. You can see this effect
    on the Facebook or Twitter timelines among others.

- en: In this project we'll build an infinite scrolling system using jQuery that mimics
    the effect seen on sites such as those mentioned earlier. We'll make a request
    for some data and display it on the page. Once the user has scrolled to the bottom
    of the page, we'll make another request for the next page of data, and so on and
    so forth as the user continues scrolling.

    order, using the infinite scrolling technique is an easy way to maximize the user
    experience of the page with progressive disclosure – showing incrementally more
    to the user.

    that we'll populate with the results of our AJAX requests. The second is an integer
    that represents the index number of the first video we wish to get. YouTube videos
    are not zero-based like regular JavaScript arrays, so we initially define the
    variable with a value of `1`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next we added our two functions that we'll use to get our data. The first is
    the request to get the profile data of the user whose feed we're going to be displaying.
    We're only going to be using this function once, when the page initially loads,
    but you'll see why it's important that we define the function as a variable in
    this way in just a moment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second function will be reused, so storing it in a variable is a great way
    to store it ready to be invoked whenever we wish to get a new page of video data.
    It's important that these functions both return the `jqXHR` objects returned by
    the `getJSON()` method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both of the requests use jQuery's `getJSON()` method to make the requests. In
    the user request we only need to set the `v` and `alt` query parameters, which
    are set in the object passed to `getJSON()` as the second argument. The user whose
    profile data we want actually forms part of the URL we are making the request
    to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The callback function for this request simply adds the contents of the `user.entry`
    object received from the request to the `userdata` property of our `data` object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second request requires slightly more configuration. We still set the API
    version we want to use with the `v` parameter, but this time we set the format
    of the response to be `jsonc` instead of `json`. In the callback function for
    this request we store the array of videos in the `videodata` property of our `data`
    object.
  prefs: []

    API has been engineered.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    The only reason we don't use it when requesting the user data is because there

- en: Next we make use of jQuery's `when()`method to initiate both of our requests,
    and then use the `done()` method to execute a callback function once both of the
    `jqXHR` objects have been resolved. This is why it was important that the single-use
    `getUser()` function is structured in the same way as the reusable `getData()`
    function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inside the callback function for `done()`, we first increment the `startIndex`
    variable by 25 so that when we make another request we get the next "page" of
    25 videos. As we have the first page of data now, when we use the `getData()`
    function later on, we'll automatically get the "next" page of results.

    There's a whole bunch of data we don't need to use, and some of the data we do
    need to use is buried within nested objects, so we simply create a new object
    called `clean` and set just the data we need on this object directly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    shortened version of the string that the function receives as an argument. The
    `substring()` function takes two arguments; the first is the position in the string
    to begin copying at, and the second argument is the number of characters to copy,
    which we fix at `200`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To show that the string has been shortened, we also append an ellipsis to the
    end of the returned string, which is why we use a helper function here, instead
    of using a substring in the template directly as we did earlier.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `formatTime()` helper function is a little more complex, but still relatively
    straightforward. This function will receive a time in seconds, which we want to
    format into a slightly nicer string that shows the hours, if there are any, the
    minutes, and seconds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We first create an empty array to store the different components of the string.
    We then create a number of variables to hold the hours, minutes, and seconds portions
    of the time string we're going to create.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hours are calculated by dividing the total number of seconds by 3600 (the
    number of seconds in an hour). We use `Math.floor()`on it so that we only get
    a whole number result. We need to calculate the minutes slightly differently because
    we need to take into account the hours if there are any.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use the modulus operator (`%`) here to remove any hours first and then divide
    the remainder by `60`, which will tell us either the total number of minutes or
    the remaining minutes after the hours have been accounted for. To work out the
    number of seconds, we just need to use the modulus operator again and the value
    `60`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then use a series of conditionals to determine which of the variables to
    add to the array. If there are any hours (which is unlikely given the nature of
    the videos) we push them into the array.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there are less than `10` minutes, we add `0` to the minutes figure and then
    push it into the array. If there are more than `10` minutes we just push the `mins`
    variable into the array. The same logic is applied to the `secs` variable before
    it is pushed into the array.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This function returns a nicely formatted time by joining the items in our array
    and using a colon as the separator. The string will be in the format `H:MM:SS`
    or `MM:SS` depending on the length of the video. Then we registered the helper
    functions with the template using JsRender's `helpers` object, which is itself
    nested within the `views` object, which is added to jQuery by the templating library.
    The helper functions we wish to add are set as the values in an object literal,
    where the keys match the function calls in our template.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next we added a function that we can call in order to render our template. The
    `renderer()` function takes a single argument, which is a Boolean specifying whether
    to render both the container template and video template, or just the video template.
    Inside the function we first cache a reference to the outer container of the video
    list.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    method. The event type is specified as `scroll`. Inside the callback function
    we first check whether the current `scrollTop` property of the `window`, plus
    the `height` of the viewport is greater than or equal to the `height` of our `videolist`
    container. We need to do this to know when the page has been scrolled to the bottom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to the user that something is happening. We append a new `<li>` element to the
    `<ul>` containing the videos and give it a class name of `loading` so that we
    can easily target it with some CSS. We set a `<span>` element as the content of
    the new list item.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can get the current value of the `scrollTop` property using jQuery's `scrollTop()`
    method. We're using a cached value for the window's `height`. Our scroll handler
    will be fairly intensive as it will be invoked every time the user scrolls, so
    using a cached value for the window `height` makes this process slightly more
    efficient.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It does mean however that if the window is resized, this value will no longer
    be accurate. We fix this by adding a resize handler for the window which recalculates
    this value every time the window is resized. This is done by chaining another
    call to the `on()`method after the scroll handler, which looks for the resize
    event of the `window` object and updates the `winHeight` variable accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    requires only a minimal amount of code – a single handler that watches for the
    scroll event and triggers a new request for more data when the document is scrolled
    to the bottom.

    functionality as an additional layer. This technique is best suited to data that
    can easily be arranged in reverse-chronological order, with new items appearing
    at the top and older items appearing at the bottom.

    sense when dealing with things such as news stories, blog posts, tweets, or status
    updates. It works very well with social data.

    for each video on the YouTube site. So when the visitor clicks on a video thumbnail
    or title, they'll be sent off to YouTube to actually watch the video.

    do would be to open up a lightbox containing a video player embedded in an `<iframe>`.
    This would let the visitor view the video without ever leaving your site. The
    response from YouTube for the videos contains a link that can be used as the `src`
    attribute of an `<iframe>`, so why not see if you can hook this up yourself?

- en: You'll notice that if you scroll to the bottom of the page, but then carry on
    scrolling down immediately, the same set of videos are requested multiple times.
    As an alternative task, see if you can prevent this from happening by only requesting
    more data if there is not currently a request in progress.

    request begins, and removing the flag when it ends. We can then only make requests
    if the flag is not set.
