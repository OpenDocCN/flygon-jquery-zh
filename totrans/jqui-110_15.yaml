- en: Throughout this book, you will have noticed that we’ve concentrated on using
    jQuery Version 2.0 as the most recent version available for use with jQuery UI.
    However, jQuery UI 1.10 comes bundled with jQuery 1.9.1 by default—why should
    we use Version 2.0, if Version 1.9.1 is bundled with jQuery UI 1.10?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason for this is simple, and relates to an important change made with
    Version 2.0, where support for Internet Explorer (IE) 6-8 has been removed. Removing
    support for these older browsers has allowed the jQuery team to remove significant
    parts of the library, as these were only included to provide workarounds for browsers!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While there has been a big push to retire IE 6 because of the security vulnerabilities,
    there is still an element of need to support it; with this in mind, the jQuery
    team are still producing and supporting versions of jQuery under the 1.x branch,
    for as long as these older browsers are still used.

- en: Each chapter’s exercise folder in the code download will come with both versions
    of jQuery included—copies of Version 2.0.3 have been added to the `JS` folder
    that comes as part of the normal download of jQuery (and which contains 1.9.1).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you need to obtain fresh copies of Version 2.x of jQuery, you can do so by
    browsing to [http://www.jquery.com/download](http://www.jquery.com/download).
    Here you will find links for both the uncompressed and compressed versions of
    jQuery 2.x. For the purposes of the exercises, I would recommend using the uncompressed
    version. You will need to right-click on the link, and choose **Save target as…**
    (or your browser’s equivalent), in order to save the file into the `JS` sub-folder.

- en: At various points throughout the book, we covered the use of themes within jQuery
    UI—a useful tool you can incorporate into your pages, is the Super Theme Switcher
    (STS) plugin, available from [https://github.com/harborhoffer/Super-Theme-Switcher](https://github.com/harborhoffer/Super-Theme-Switcher).
    Once implemented, you can use it to switch between themes at will; it's a great
    way to see how your site's widgets will look when a theme is changed, before making
    that change permanent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is particularly useful if you need to edit an existing theme; it is better
    practice to place your edits into an override file, and call this separately;
    editing the core UI CSS files means that you may face issues when upgrading to
    the next version of jQuery UI, as customizations could be lost.

    the widgets, effects, methods, and selectors provided by jQuery UI. You can view
    this documentation from [http://api.jqueryui.com](http://api.jqueryui.com); another
