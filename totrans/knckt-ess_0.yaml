- en: One of the hardest problems to solve when we build the user interface is to
    synchronize data that developers manage behind the scenes, in the code, and data
    that is shown to the user. The first step that developers made was to separate
    the presentation and the logic. That separation allowed developers to manage both
    sides better and separately. But communication between these two layers still
    became hard. That was because JavaScript was considered a non-important language
    and we used to use it just for validation. Then jQuery gave us a clue about how
    powerful this language could be. But still data was managed in the server and
    we just displayed static presentations. That makes the user experience poor and
    slow.

- en: Over the last few years, a new kind of architectural pattern has emerged. It
    is called the MVVM pattern. Libraries and frameworks that use this kind of pattern
    make it easy for developers to synchronize views and data. One of these libraries
    is Knockout, and the framework that uses Knockout is named Durandal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knockout is a fast and cross-browser-compatible library that helps us to develop
    client-side applications with a better user experience.

- en: Developers don't need to worry any more about data synchronization. Knockout
    binds our code to the HTML elements showing the state of our code to the user
    in real time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This dynamic binding makes us forget about coding synchronization, and we can
    focus our effort on coding the important features of our application.

    In this book, you will learn the basics of Knockout and Durandal and we will go
    into the best design practices and patterns of JavaScript.
