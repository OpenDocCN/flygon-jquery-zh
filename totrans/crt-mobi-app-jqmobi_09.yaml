- en: If this statement resonates within you, then you need to be familiar with content
    management systems (CMS). They're an easy and powerful way to put publishing power
    in your users' hands so that you can focus on less tedious, better paying work.
    All you have to do is help the client set up their CMS, choose and customize their
    templates, and leave the content creation and maintenance to them. CMS is often
    at the core of both small business websites and corporate websites.

    Brochureware sites have never had it so easy. In fact, platforms like WordPress
    and Squarespace are making this process so easy that often a web developer is
    not needed for anything more than customizing the look and feel.

    guarantees that if you're going to be making mobile web apps, at one point or
    another you're going to get a client that already has a site in a CMS, and you
    need to know how to integrate.

    8.3 percent are built on WordPress. The next highest is Drupal, with 2.95 percent.
    Granted that doesn't sound like much, but look at this chart from [http://trends.builtwith.com/cms](http://trends.builtwith.com/cms).

    with WordPress by creating a hosted site on [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com),
    or you can download the source and install it on any machine you like by going
    to [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org). While you're experimenting, I would
    highly recommend the latter approach. The version used in this chapter is 3.5.

    plugins and themes to use. For WordPress, I would *not* recommend a jQuery Mobile

    Mobile themes that will serve you well. Some are free, some paid. Either way,
    try not to reinvent the wheel. Pick a theme that is closest to what you want and
    then tweak it. Chances are, by now, you''re more than good enough to modify existing
    theme files. Here are the links to some themes I found and liked. Pick one, unzip

    to store content. This means that you can create mobile sites that automatically
    pull content from desktop pages simply by referencing the JCR content nodes of
    the desktop pages or by allowing users to type directly into an interface that
    looks like a mobile screen.

    of jQM is a bit outdated, it's easy to change the templates. The mobile content
    author interface comes with simulated phone interfaces to frame the content so
    it looks roughly like it would on a real phone or tablet. You can switch device
    profiles right in the author interface. While this is not a true simulation of
    those devices since it's all taking place in whatever browser you're using, it
    is still very, very handy.

    development two years ago. Today, there are lots of options for jQuery Mobile;
    there are also some other responsive themes. I didn't bother making an exhaustive
    list of everything that Google can give us. By the time this book is published,
    that will have changed, even in the space of a month. The important thing to remember
    is that we don't have to reinvent the wheel, and we don't have to saddle ourselves
    with content updates. Give your clients the power to make minor updates themselves,
    and you get back to the business of your business. As useful as CMS is, we won't
    be covering it again. The next chapter will be a return to custom development,
    where we'll combine everything we've learned so far.
