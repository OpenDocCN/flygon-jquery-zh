    as they provide the primary way for users to interact with the website. jQuery
    Mobile goes a long way to making forms both usable and elegantly designed for
    mobile devices.

    them. As part of our discussion, we will be posting our forms to the server. In
    order to have the server actually do something with the response we're going to
    make use of an application server from Adobe called ColdFusion. ColdFusion is
    not free for production use, but is 100% free for development and is a great server
    for building web applications. You do not need to download ColdFusion. If you
    do not, the forms you use within this chapter should not be submitted. This chapter
    does talk about how forms are submitted, but the response to the forms isn't really
    critical. If you know another language, like PHP, you should be able to simply
    mimic the code ColdFusion is using to echo back the form data.

    Versions exist for Windows, OS X, and Linux. As stated above, you can run ColdFusion
    for free on your development server with no timeout restrictions.

    know about what jQuery Mobile will do with your HTML forms:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All forms will submit their data via Ajax. That means the data is sent directly
    to the action of your form and the result will be brought back to the user and
    placed within the page that held the form. This prevents a full page reload.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All form fields are automatically enhanced, each in their own way. As we go
    on in the chapter you will see examples of this, but basically jQuery Mobile modifies
    your form fields to work better on a mobile device. A great example of this are
    buttons. jQuery Mobile automatically widens and heightens buttons to make them
    easier to click in the small form factor of a phone. If for some reason you don't
    like this, jQuery Mobile provides a way to disable this, either on a global or
    per use basis.

    in a moment. Our form has two text fields, one for name and one for e-mail. The
    last item is just the submit button. So outside of using a `fieldcontain` wrapper
    and ensuring we had labels for our form fields, nothing else special is going

    textarea`, by default, can be very difficult to work with on a mobile device,
    especially as the amount of text grows beyond the size of the `textarea` and a
    scroll bar is added. In the following code listing, we''ve simply modified the
    previous form to include a third item, a bio field that uses `textarea`. The complete
    file may be found in the book''s code ZIP file. The following code snippet is

- en: 'Another option to use with select fields is grouping. jQuery Mobile allows
    you to vertically or horizontally group together multiple select fields. In both
    cases, all that''s required is to wrap your select fields in a `fieldset` using
    the `data-role` of `controlgroup`, much like we did earlier for radio and checkboxes.
    The following code snippet is an example of a vertically aligned group of select
    fields:'

- en: Note how jQuery Mobile groups them together and nicely rounds the corners. The
    horizontal version can be achieved by adding a `data-type="horizontal"` attribute
    to the fieldset tag. It's also important to remove the `div` using "fieldcontain".

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Along with taking regular form fields and making them work better, jQuery Mobile
    also helps make some of the newer HTML5 form fields work correctly across multiple
    browsers. While support still isn't nailed down on the desktop across every major
    browser, jQuery Mobile provides built-in support for search, toggle, and slider
    fields. Let's take a look at each one.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simplest of the three new fields, search fields simply adds a quick delete
    icon to the end of the field after you begin typing. Some devices will also put
    an hourglass icon in front as well, to help convey the idea of the field being
    used for some type of search. To use this field, simply switch your type from
    text to search. As in the following example from `test8.html:`

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Flip toggle fields are controls that flip back between one and two values. Creating
    a toggle field involves using a select control with a particular data-role value.
    Now, here is where things may get a bit confusing. To enable a select field to
    turn into a toggle field, you use `data-role="slider"`. In a little bit we're
    going to look at another slider control, but it uses a different technique. Just
    keep in mind that even though you'll be seeing`"slider"` in the HTML, it's really
    a toggle control we are creating. Let's look at a simple example. (You can find
    the complete source for this in `test9.html):`

    fields, this is based on an HTML5 specification that works in some browsers and
    not others. jQuery Mobile simply makes it work everywhere. To enable this field,
    we take a regular text field and switch the type to`"range"` To give our slider
    a range we also provide a `min` and `max` value. You can also add additional color
    to the slider by adding the attribute: `data-highlight="true"`. The following
    code snippet is a sample. (You can find the complete file in `test10.html):`'

    this works in some browsers, it is not yet directly supported by jQuery Mobile.
    In other words, jQuery Mobile won't try to add this support on a browser that
    doesn't have it built-in. You can add the attribute as long as you are aware it
    may not always work as intended.
