- en: Imagine a scenario, if you will, where you're an intermediate-level developer,
    reasonably au fait with writing code, who feels that there should be more to developing
    jQuery than just punching keys into a text editor.

- en: You'd be right; anyone can write code. To take that step towards being a more
    rounded developer, we must think further afield. Gone are the days of writing
    dozens of chained statements that take a degree to understand and debug, and in
    their place are the decisions that help us make smarter decisions about using
    jQuery and that make more effective use of time in our busy lives.

    solutions; throughout this book, we'll take look at a variety of topics that will
    help develop your skills, make you consider all the options, and understand that
    there is more to writing jQuery code.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1 "Chapter 1. Installing jQuery"), *Installing
    jQuery*, kicks off our journey into the world of mastering jQuery, where you will
    learn that there is more to downloading and installing jQuery than simply using
    CDN or local links. We''ll take a look at how to install jQuery using package
    managers, how we can customize the elements of our download, as well as how to
    add source maps and more to help fine-tune our copy of the library.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](part0021.xhtml#aid-K0RQ1 "Chapter 2. Customizing jQuery"), *Customizing
    jQuery*, takes things further—you may find that the elements of jQuery don''t
    quite work the way you want. In this chapter, we''ll take a look at how you can
    create and distribute patches that can be applied temporarily in order to extend
    or alter the core functionality within jQuery.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](part0031.xhtml#aid-TI1E1 "Chapter 3. Organizing Your Code"), *Organizing
    Your Code*, explores the use of jQuery design patterns, which is a useful concept
    in maintaining well-organized code that makes developing and debugging easier.
    We''ll take a look at some examples of patterns and how they fit in with jQuery.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](part0037.xhtml#aid-1394Q1 "Chapter 4. Working with Forms"), *Working
    with Forms*, takes a look at the doyen of form functionality - validating responses
    on forms. We''ll explore how you can be more effective at form validation, before
    using it to great effect in a contact form that employs AJAX, and develop a file
    upload form.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](part0047.xhtml#aid-1CQAE1 "Chapter 5. Integrating AJAX"), *Integrating
    AJAX*, examines how we can improve the speed of loading data on static sites,
    with the use of callbacks to help manage multiple AJAX requests. We''ll take a
    look at AJAX best practices and explore how best to manage these requests through
    the use of jQuery''s Deferreds and Promises functionalities.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](part0056.xhtml#aid-1LCVG1 "Chapter 6. Animating in jQuery"), *Animating
    in jQuery*, takes us on a journey to discover how we can be smarter at managing
    animations within jQuery, and explores how best to manage the jQuery queue to
    prevent animation build-ups. We''ll also learn how we can implement custom animations
    and why jQuery isn''t always the right tool to use in order to move elements on
    a page.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](part0067.xhtml#aid-1VSLM1 "Chapter 7. Advanced Event Handling"),
    *Advanced Event Handling*, examines how many developers may simply use .on() or
    .off() to handle events, but you''ll see that there is more to using these methods,
    if you really want to take advantage of jQuery. We''ll create a number of custom
    events before we explore the use of event delegation to better manage when these
    event handlers are called in our code.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](part0073.xhtml#aid-25JP21 "Chapter 8. Using jQuery Effects"), *Using
    jQuery Effects*, continues our journey, with a quick recap on using effects in
    jQuery, as we explore how we can create custom effects with callbacks and learn
    how to better manage the queue that forms the basis of their use within jQuery.'

    APIs"), *Using the Web Performance APIs*, starts the second part of the book,
    where we explore some of the more interesting options available to us when using
    jQuery. In this chapter, we''ll discover how to use the Page Visibility API with
    jQuery and see how we can use it to provide a smoother appearance, reduce resources,
    and still maintain complex animations on our pages. Intrigued? You will be, when
    you visit this chapter!'

    *Manipulating Images*, illustrates how, with the use of jQuery and some reasonably
    simple math, we can apply all kinds of effects to images. We can perform something
    as simple as blurring images to creating custom effects. We''ll then use some
    of these techniques to create a simple signature page that exports images, and
    apply all kinds of effects to images extracted from your own webcam.'

    and distributing plugins. With more and more functionality being moved to using
    plugins, we''ll cover some of the tips and tricks behind creating your own plugins;
    you''ll see that there is more to it than just writing code!'

    library that takes the best elements of Node, JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, and plain
    HTML and combines them into something that blurs the boundaries between desktops
    and the online world. We''ll work through some existing online code and convert
    it for use as a desktop application, before packaging it and making it available

    of your code. You''ll see how easy it is to get the basics from DOM inspectors,

    with Node and Grunt, which we will use at various stages throughout the book.
