- en: On November 22, 2011, I started my blog at [RoughlyBrilliant.com](http://RoughlyBrilliant.com)
    as a way to share everything I was learning about jQuery Mobile and Mobile UX
    (user experience). I had no idea what it would turn into and what would strike
    a chord. Since it's a developer-centric blog, it came as a bit of a surprise to
    me that the remarks I made about stepping away from the keyboard and sketching
    our designs first would spark the most positive comments. It is my firm belief
    that the best way to start your jQuery Mobile projects, is on a pad of Post-it
    notes.

    the most foreign. But ultimately, I believe it will probably be the chapter that
    gives you the most growth. It's normal for developers to sit down and start coding,
    but it's time to grow past that. It is time to step away from the keyboard!

    people would use it no matter how bad it was. It would generally garner some level
    of success simply by virtue of its existence. We now live in an age where there
    is a lot more competition. Now, with tools like jQuery Mobile, anyone can quickly
    craft impressive-looking mobile sites in a matter of hours.

    compete on price. People love a good value. But there is something that has always
    seemed to trump price and that is the user's experience. **User experience** (**UX**)
    is what differentiates most of the world's most successful brands.

    know what jQuery Mobile can do. We know what details the framework will fill in
    and can draw just enough to tell each other what we're thinking. However, when
    drawing for customers (or people who you know are more visual and detail-oriented),
    we would do well to take the few extra seconds to add the finer details like shadows,
    gradient shading, and, especially, the logo. Business owners are very proud of
    their babies, and your effort to include it will instantly grant your drawing
    that little bit of extra gravity.

    give a sense of depth. A little polish goes a long way.

    most artistic way is to use pencil but the problem with drawing in pencil is that
    it leads to smudging, and paying too much attention to fine detail. These drawings
    are supposed to be rough. If you screw up slightly, no big deal. After all, you've
    probably spent less than a minute on each drawing and that's the idea. The goal
    is to get to a shared, visual understanding quickly.
