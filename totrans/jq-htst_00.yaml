- en: Welcome to *jQuery Hotshot*. This book has been written to provide as much exposure
    to the different methods and utilities that make up jQuery as possible. You don't
    need to be a jQuery hotshot to read and understand the projects this book contains,
    but by the time you've finished the book, you should be a jQuery hotshot.

- en: As well as learning how to use jQuery, we are also going to look at a wide range
    of related technologies including using some of the more recent HTML5 and related
    APIs, such as localStorage, how to use and create jQuery plugins, and how to use
    other jQuery libraries such as jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile, and jQuery templates.

- en: jQuery has been changing the way we write JavaScript for many years. It wasn't
    the first JavaScript library to gain popularity and widespread usage among developers,
    but its powerful selector engine, cross-browser compatibility, and easy-to-use
    syntax quickly propelled it to be one of the most popular and widely-used JavaScript
    frameworks of all time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As well as being easy-to-use and abstracting complex and powerful techniques
    into a simple API, jQuery is also backed by an ever-growing community of developers,
    and is possibly the only JavaScript library protected by a not-for-profit foundation
    to ensure that development of the library remains active, and that it remains
    open source and free for everyone for as long as it's available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best things is that anyone can get involved. You can write plugins
    for other developers to use in order to complete common or not-so-common tasks.
    You can work with the bug tracker to raise new issues, or work with the source
    to add features, or fix bugs and give back in the form of pull requests through
    Git. In short, there is something to do for everyone who wants to get involved,
    whatever their background or skillset.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every project in this book is built around jQuery; it's the foundation for everything
    we do. To download a copy of jQuery, we can visit the jQuery site at [http://jquery.com/](http://jquery.com/).
    There are download buttons here to obtain production and development versions
    of the library, as well as a wealth of other resources including full API documentation,
    tutorials, and much, much more to help you familiarize yourself with using the
    library.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the core concepts of jQuery is based on selecting one or more elements
    from the **Document Object Model** (**DOM**) of a web page, and then operating
    on those elements somehow using the methods exposed by the library.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll look at a range of different ways of selecting elements from the page
    throughout the projects in the book, as well as a wide selection of the different
    methods we can call on elements, but let's look at a basic example now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let''s say there is an element on a page that has an `id` attribute of `myElement`.
    We can select this element using its `id` with the following code:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: As you can see, we use simple CSS selectors in order to select the elements
    from the page that we wish to work with. These can range from simple `id` selectors
    as in this example, `class` selectors, or much more complex attribute selectors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As well as using `jQuery` to select elements, it is also common to use the
    `$` alias. This would be written using `$` instead of `jQuery`, as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE1]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Once the element has been selected in this way, we would say that the element
    is wrapped with jQuery, or that it's a jQuery object containing the element. Using
    the `jQuery` (or `$`) method with a selector always results in a collection of
    elements being returned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there are no elements that match the selector, the collection has a length
    of `0`. When `id` selectors are used, we would expect the collection to contain
    a single element. There is no limit as to how many elements may be returned in
    the collection; it all depends on the selector used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can now call jQuery methods that operate on the element or elements that
    have been selected. One of the great features of most jQuery methods is that the
    same method may be used to either get a value, or set a value, depending on the
    arguments passed to the method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So to continue our example where we have selected the element whose `id` attribute
    is `myElement`, if we wanted to find out its `width` in pixels, we could use jQuery''s
    `width()` method:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'This will return a number which specifies how many pixels wide the element
    is. However, if we wish to set the `width` of our element, we could pass the number
    of pixels that we''d like the element to have its width set to as an argument
    to the same method:'

- en: Of course, there is much more to using jQuery than these simple examples show,
    and we'll explore much more in the projects contained in this book, but this simplicity
    is at the heart of the library and is one of the things that have made it so popular.

    a browser and a simple text editor. Of course, a complete IDE is always going
    to make things easier, with features such as code completion, code coloring, and
    collapsible blocks. So using an IDE over a simple text editor is recommended.

    Several projects use third-party services hosted on the Internet in order to consume

    applications.
