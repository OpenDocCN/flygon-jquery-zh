    web page in a browser and wait for the second set of buttons to be created and
    then click on the additional **Button 1** button, no click event will be fired.
    Click on the additional **Button 2** button, and you will see the alert box being

    user experience feature, as the user is visually aware of the characters that
    they cannot provide instead of having to wait for a response from the server informing

    validation done on the client side should always be mirrored on the server. This
    is because it is extremely easy for a user to bypass client-side validation. It
    is often as easy as turning off JavaScript from the browser settings. Remember
    that any client-side language such as JavaScript is completely open to manipulation
    by the end user. For this reason, client-side validation should only be used as
    a user experience enhancement and never a form of explicit validation of data
    input.
