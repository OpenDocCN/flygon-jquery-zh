- en: jQuery Tools is a compact, powerful library that contains enough components
    to provide the most important functionality on any website. Many UI libraries
    contain a myriad of components, such as list boxes, ranges, sortable lists, and
    the like. While this can be used to build a range of online-based applications
    that are useful in company intranets, for example, it is not so useful when building
    normal websites.

- en: Websites are built to present information and to look good—jQuery Tools is designed
    to enhance any site that uses them, while harnessing the power that modern JavaScript
    techniques can offer. With jQuery Tools, you are not tied to any predefined HTML,
    CSS structures, or strict programming rules—you can include the library in your
    pages and start to use its functionality immediately. The tools are designed to
    be customized to your liking, while maintaining the core functionality that goes
    to make up JQuery Tools.

    jQuery Tools UI Library*, introduces you as the reader to the library billed as
    the "missing UI library for the Web". It explains how to get hold of jQuery Tools,
    outlines the tools you will need to develop webpages which use this functionality,
    and outlines some of the best practices to use with jQuery Tools.'

    Along with your UI Tools*, delves into each part of the jQuery Tools UI library,
    and how to implement the basic tools into your website. Within each part of the
    UI library, a walk-through demonstration is included, as well as a more advanced
    example of what can be achieved using the library.'

    form functionality within jQuery Tools. It outlines how to submit and validate
    content in a form, as well as entering numbers using `RangeInput` and dates using
    `DateInput`. It also demonstrates how to ensure all content is validated correctly,
    using HTML5 standards.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. jQuery Tools Toolbox"), *jQuery Tools Toolbox*,
    introduces a small collection of tools which, in most cases, can either be used
    on their own, or as part of one of the main tools from the Library. It notes that
    although some of the technologies are becoming outdated (thanks to the modern
    advances of HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript), they can still perform some useful functions
    within your projects.'

- en: '*Using jQuery Tools in WordPress* is an additional PDF available for download
    from Packt''s website, which accompanies this book. It contains some useful ideas
    and examples for using jQuery Tools within the confines of a content management
    system. Although the examples are based around the well-known and popular WordPress™
    system, the principles could easily be applied to other, similar systems.'
