- en: Mobile is the fastest growing technology sector in existence. It is a wave of
    change that has shattered all analysts' expectations. You have the choice to harness
    that wave or to be swept under. In *Creating Mobile Apps with jQuery Mobile*,
    we'll take you through several projects of increasing complexity across a variety
    of industries. At the same time, we'll tackle several mobile usability and experience
    issues that are common to all mobile implementations, not just jQuery Mobile.

    a host of other technologies and techniques to create truly unique offerings.
    This will be fun. It will be challenging, and by the end, you will be quoting
    Bob the Builder, "Can we build it? Yes we can!"

    to predict who and what will win. Just ask RIM (makers of BlackBerry devices)
    who went from total domination down to 6 percent of the world's market share.
    With this level and speed of change, how can you know that you are choosing the

    and the growth rate shows no signs of slowing. ([http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery](http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery)).
    It is, by far, the most trusted name in open source JavaScript libraries. Now
    that they have tossed their hat into the mobile ring, you can bet that jQuery
    Mobile is a pretty safe choice for reaching the most people with the smallest
    effort.

    part of their mission through their exceptional adherence to **progressive enhancement**
    (**PE**). When an escalator breaks, it does not become completely useless. It
    becomes simply stairs. In the same way, jQuery Mobile does some really awesome
    things for those who have smartphones. But what about the rest? They will see
    a standard web page without all the bells and whistles. At the end of the day,
    a well-crafted jQM page can work for everyone.

    of code. This makes it an ideal tool for even the newest of newbs to jump in and
    get their feet wet in the mobile space. Designers with no real programming experience
    can easily turn their visions into skinned, working prototypes. For those of us
    who can program, it means that there is much less coding we need to do and that
    is always a good thing. jQM perfectly fits the jQuery core motto of "write less,
    do more."

- en: Much is being said these days about RWD. I'm all for it. A single unified site
    is every developer's dream. However, this usually requires that the website be
    built from the ground up with RWD in mind. This also presumes that every page
    of the site is worth serving to a mobile audience. If you ever have such a growth
    opportunity, enjoy it.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    whole new site from scratch, nor the time and tripled budget to do the job right.
    And, if we're being quite honest… many sites have a lot of useless pages that
    have no business being in the ultra-focused, task-oriented, get-in-get-out-world
    that is the mobile web. You know it. I know it. A custom crafted solution that
    perfectly fits the users' needs and context is usually a better way to go.

    that would be tantamount to felling a forest with an axe so you could make the
    boards to build your own house. You are no less of a craftsman for using premade
    components to make your masterpiece. Mobile frameworks exist for a reason, the
    amount of development time and cross-device testing that goes into them will save
    you more time and headaches than you can fathom.
