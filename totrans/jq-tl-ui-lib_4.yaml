- en: While Flash is still very useful, it is fast becoming an old technology; early
    iPads and other products did not support it, although this is changing for later
    models. However, HTML5 and JavaScript are taking over—HTML5 includes support for
    the`<canvas>` and`<video>` tags, without the need for additional support. This
    allows for many Flash-like behaviors and visualizations to be built with simple
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; images could equally be used, although in many cases,
    they won't be required. Support for both tags is still mixed, with better support
    in WebKit and Mozilla-based browsers than in Internet Explorer; FlashEmbed comes
    into its own by allowing Flash to be played in older browsers, using a common
    standard—the library handles the different embedding code required.

- en: On a different note, you can also use FlashEmbed to embed fonts, using the SIFR
    technology; this should be used with caution, as the technology hasn't been updated
    for quite some time. Browsers contain support for `@font-face`, which allows the
    display of fonts in all major browsers including IE6-9, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari,
    without the need for additional external libraries. SIFR will only work for embedding
    small Flash files, as it is processor-intensive and carries a big overhead for
    very little extra benefit—you should use it with care!

    on its own, but as part of the Overlay tool featured earlier in this book. However,
    Expose has been developed to take this concept further, and work as a standalone
    tool or one integrated into Overlay. It doesn't matter in which *mode* it is used
    but you can use it to expose all manner of objects, such as images, forms, or

    along with your UI Tools*. We also looked at FlashEmbed—even though the technology
    is arguably being superseded by the advances of HTML5 functionality in newer browsers,
    it can still play a vital role in older browsers for as long as they still exist.
    Then we learned about mousewheel and history, and how although you may use them
    separately in your projects, it is more likely that you will use them as a configuration
    option in one of the many tools that make up the jQuery Tools library.

  zh: 在本章中，我们看了 jQuery Tools 的第三部分和最后一部分，即工具箱。我们学习了如何使用 Expose 在页面上公开对象，以及这实际上是作为主要覆盖功能的基础，来自[第
    2 章](ch02.html "第 2 章。与你的 UI 工具相处")，*与你的 UI 工具相处*。我们还了解了 FlashEmbed——尽管这项技术在新浏览器中的
    HTML5 功能的进步可能会取代它，但在旧浏览器中仍然可以发挥关键作用，只要它们还存在。然后，我们学习了关于 mousewheel 和 history，尽管你可能会在项目中分开使用它们，但更可能是将它们用作
    jQuery Tools 库中众多工具之一的配置选项。
