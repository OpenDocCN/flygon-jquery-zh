    has now spread to various devices ranging from large desktop monitors to tablets,
    Smartphones, smart TVs, and outdoor displays. It has also increased the functionality
    and interfaces of sites and the way we interact with them.

    to hone our developing skills using grid system frameworks and providing a differentiated
    and enriched user experience.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we achieve all this using CSS3 and jQuery, which offer great integration
    options between devices, OSs, and different browser versions. Another advantage
    of using jQuery is the speed of development achieved by using plugins maintained
    by the collaborative community. We do not need to reinvent something that is already
    done! Furthermore, improvements are always welcome and your collaboration to the
    community will help everybody.
