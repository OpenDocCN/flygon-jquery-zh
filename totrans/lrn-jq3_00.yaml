    has happened between now and then: new JavaScript libraries, more consistency
    across browsers, and enhancements to JavaScript itself. The one thing that hasn''t
    changed in 10 years is the expressiveness and conciseness of jQuery. Even with
    all the new hotness out there today, jQuery remains the go-to tool of choice for
    getting work done quickly, and efficiently.'

- en: This book has a long history behind it, and it remains intact in its fifth edition.
    It has been a successful book because it is straight to the point and easy to
    follow. I've done my best to preserve what has worked so well for this book. My
    goal is to modernize learning jQuery for the current web-development landscape.

- en: '[Chapter 1](33c0dcc2-d368-4c19-b3aa-15fd462917f8.xhtml), *Getting Started*,
    gets your feet wet with the jQuery JavaScript library. The chapter begins with
    a description of jQuery and what it can do for you. It then walks you through
    downloading and setting up the library as well as writing your first script.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](195342ed-f533-42e7-8a8d-f9a3462382b7.xhtml), *Selecting Elements*,
    teaches you how to use jQuery''s selector expressions and DOM-traversal methods
    to find elements on the page, wherever they may be. You''ll use jQuery to apply
    styling to a diverse set of page elements, sometimes in a way that pure CSS cannot.'

    walks you through jQuery''s event-handling mechanism to fire off behaviors when
    browser events occur. You''ll see how jQuery makes it easy to attach events to
    elements unobtrusively, even before the page finishes loading. Also, you''ll get
    an overview of deeper topics, such as event bubbling, delegation, and namespacing.'
