    buttons one to the left and one to the right. Buttons can be added simply by creating
    links in your header. The first link will be to the left of the text and the second
    link to the right. The following code snippet is an example:'

    button. For devices that do, like Android phones, hitting the back button will
    work just fine in a jQuery Mobile application. Whatever page the user was on previously
    will be loaded as soon as the button is clicked. But on other devices, like the
    iPhone, there is no such button to click. While you can provide links to navigate
    around pages yourself, jQuery Mobile provides some nice built in support for navigating
    backwards out of the box.

    the header of the second page automatically. Next, we also added a simple link
    in the page content. While the actual URL for the link is blank, make note of
    the `data-rel="back"` attribute. jQuery Mobile will detect this link and automatically
    send the user to the previous page. The following code snippet is an example:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous discussion about headers and footers, you saw a few examples
    of how buttons can be added. These buttons could be useful for navigating in your
    site. But what if a particular page is somewhat long? A blog entry, for example,
    could be quite long, especially when viewed on a mobile device. As the user scrolls,
    the header, or footer, could be off screen. jQuery Mobile provides a way to create
    fixed position headers and footers. With this feature enabled, the header and
    footer will always be visible. They may disappear while the user scrolls, but
    as soon as they lift their finger and stop scrolling, the header and footer will
    reappear. This feature can be enabled by adding `data-position="fixed"` to the
    div tag used for either the header or footer. `Listing 3-2` demonstrates an example.
    In order to ensure the page actually scrolls, many paragraphs of text were repeated.
    This has been removed from the code in the book, but exists in the actual file.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: We won't bother with a screenshot of this example as it won't exactly convey
    the feature well, but if you try this in your mobile device, notice while scrolling
    up and down, as soon as you lift your finger the header and footer will both pop
    in. This gives the user access to them no matter how large the page may be.
  prefs: []

- en: Full screen positioning
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another option to consider is what's called full screen positioning. This is
    a metaphor commonly used with pictures, but can also be used where fixed positioned
    headers and footers are used. In this scenario, the header and footer appear and
    disappear with clicks. So, with a photo, this allows you a view of the photo as
    it is, but also the ability to get the header and footer back with a simple click.
    Perhaps, instead of full screen positioning you can consider it as *retrievable*
    headers and footers instead. In general, this is best used when you want the content
    of the page to be viewed by itself, again, an excellent example of this would
    be pictures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    used to define the page. `Listing 3-3` demonstrates this feature, as shown in

    but jQuery Mobile has a cleaner version of this called NavBars (or navigation
    bars). These are full screen-wide bars used to hold buttons. jQuery Mobile also
    supports highlighting one button at a time as an active button. When used for
    navigation, this is an easy way to mark a page as being active.

    headers and footers persist over a long page. Further, we demonstrated *full screen
    mode* for headers and footers. These are headers and footers that appear and disappear
    with clicks - perfect for images and other items you want to show in a full screen
    type view on your mobile device. Finally, we saw how to combine persistent footers
