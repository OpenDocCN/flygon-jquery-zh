    itself, even though it consumes more time than we expected in our test emulators;
    browser tools are the solutions found to make testing faster, but will not be
    able to reproduce a website 100 percent identical to the real thing.

    be chosen and the most common device models in the market. And the fact that it
    does not require memorizing all of them makes it easier. Or if you want to customize
    your own size, you can perform it just by clicking on the **Custom Screen Size**
