- en: To follow the code used in this book, all you will need is a programmer's text
    editor. A full-blown Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can be used, but
    it is not required. Most of the examples will run directly in a browser, with
    the exception of those covering Ajax. In order to run the Ajax examples, you'll
    need a web server or an IDE with a built-in server.
