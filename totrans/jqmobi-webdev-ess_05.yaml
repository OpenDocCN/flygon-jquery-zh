    time now. (Ok, just to be clear, we''re making this up!) They were an early innovator
    in the online world, beginning with a simple website in 1996 and gradually improving
    their online presence over the years. Online visitors to the Hotel Camden can
    now see virtual tours of rooms, check the grounds with a stunning 3D Adobe Flash
    plugin, and actually make reservations online. Recently, though, the owners of
    Hotel Camden have decided they want to move into the mobile space. For now, they
    want to start simply and create a mobile-optimized site which includes the following
    features:'

    accepting that our mobile version will be somewhat limited (for this version),
    so at a minimum we should provide a way for users to return to the desktop version
    of the site.

    site without it:'

    jQuery page model we've discussed before. You can see what the CSS and JavaScript
    includes, as well as the div wrappers that set up our page, header, footer, and
    the content. Within our content div you can also see a list being used. We've
    left the URL blank for the Non-Mobile site option ("Non-Mobile Site") as we don't
    have a real website for the Camden Hotel.

    of what the staff feel are the most common requests, with the number one being
    simply finding the hotel and the last option (ignoring leaving the site) being
    able to contact the hotel.

    we have some marketing speak fluff on top. Immediately below this though is the
    address and the map. We created the map using one of the cooler Google features,
    Static Maps. You can read more about Google Static Maps at its home page: [http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/).
    Essentially, it is a way to create static maps via URL parameters. There''s no
    zooming or panning in these maps, but if you are just trying to show a user where
    your business is located, it''s an incredibly powerful and simple way to do so.
    While there are a large number of options you can use with this API, our example
    simply centers it on an address and adds a marker there as well. The label **H**
    is used for the marker, but a custom icon could be used instead. The following
    screenshot shows how this looks:'

    way to ask the mobile device to call a phone number. Clicking it brings up the

    scheme uses the form "sms", so to begin an SMS message to a phone number, you

    but effective, website for a fake hotel. This website shared essential information
    for folks needing to learn about the hotel while on a mobile device, made use
    of Google's Static Maps API to create a simple map showing the hotel's location,
    and demonstrates the use of `tel` and `mailto` URL schemes for automatic phone
    dialing and e-mailing.
