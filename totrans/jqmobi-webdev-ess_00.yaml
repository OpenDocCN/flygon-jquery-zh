- en: On August 11, 2010, nearly two years ago, John Resig (creator of jQuery) announced
    the jQuery Mobile project. While focused on the UI framework, it was also a recognition
    of jQuery itself as a tool for mobile sites and that work would be done to the
    core framework itself, to make it work better on devices. Release after release,
    the jQuery Mobile project evolved into a powerful framework encompassing more
    platforms, more features, and better performance with every update.

- en: But what do we mean when we say a *UI framework?* What does it mean for developers
    and designers? jQuery Mobile provides a way to turn regular HTML (and CSS) into
    mobile friendly sites. As you will see soon in the first chapter, you can take
    a regular HTML page, add in the required bits for jQuery Mobile (essentially five
    lines of HTML), and find your page transformed into a mobile-friendly version
    instantly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike other frameworks, jQuery Mobile is focused on HTML. In fact, for a framework
    tied to jQuery, you can do a heck of a lot of work without writing one line of
    JavaScript. It's a powerful, practical way of creating mobile websites that any
    existing HTML developer can pick up and adapt within a few hours. Compare this
    to other frameworks, such as Sencha Touch. Sencha Touch is also a powerful framework,
    but its approach is radically different, using JavaScript to help define and layout
    pages. jQuery Mobile is much friendlier to people who are more familiar with HTML,
    as opposed to JavaScript. jQuery Mobile is *touch friendly*, which will make sense
    to anyone who has used a smart phone and struggled to click the exact right spot
    on a website with tiny text and hard to spot links. It will make sense to anyone
    who accidentally clicked on a Reset button instead of Submit. jQuery Mobile will
    enhance your content to help solve these issues. Regular buttons become large,
    fat, and easy to hit buttons. Links can be turned into list based navigation systems.
    Content can be split into virtual pages with smooth transitions. You will be surprised
    just how jQuery Mobile works without writing much code at all.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Ah, the million dollar question. Luckily this one is easy to answer: nothing.
    jQuery Mobile, like jQuery itself, is completely free to use for any purpose.
    Not only that, it''s completely open source. Don''t like how something works?
    You can change it. Want something not supported by the framework? You can add
    it. To be fair, digging deep into the code base is probably something most folks
    will not be comfortable doing. However, the fact that you can if you need to,
    and the fact that other people can, leads to a product that will be open to development
    by the community at large.'

- en: Finally, along with not paying a dime to get, and work with, jQuery Mobile,
    the best thing is that you probably already have all the skills necessary to work
    with the framework. As you will see in the upcoming chapters, jQuery Mobile is
    an HTML based framework. If you know HTML, even just simple HTML, you can use
    the jQuery Mobile framework. Knowledge of CSS and JavaScript is a plus, but not
    entirely required. (While jQuery Mobile uses a lot of CSS and JavaScript behind
    the scenes, you don't actually have to write any of this yourself!)

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: jQuery Mobile does not create native applications. You'll see later in the book
    how you can combine jQuery Mobile with *wrapper* technologies such as PhoneGap
    to create native apps but, in general, jQuery Mobile is for building websites.
    The question on whether to develop a website or a mobile app is not something
    this book can answer. You need to look at your business needs and see what will
    satisfy them. Because we are not building mobile apps themselves, you do not have
    to worry about setting up any accounts with Google or Apple, or paying any fees
    for the marketplace. Any user with a mobile device that includes a browser will
    be able to view your mobile-optimized sites.

    cover syntax, features, and development in general, much like this book. While
    the material may cover some of the same ground, if you find something confusing
    here, try the official docs. Sometimes a second explanation can really help.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, the jQuery Mobile forum ([http://forum.jquery.com/jquery-mobile](http://forum.jquery.com/jquery-mobile)),
    is an open ended discussion list for jQuery Mobile topics. This is the perfect
    place to ask questions. Also, it's a good place to learn about problems other
    people are having. You may even be able to help them. One of the best ways to
    learn a new topic is by helping others.
