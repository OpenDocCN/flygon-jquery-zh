    image format, which allowed a sequence of frames to be stored as a single image
    and played by supporting software.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The GIF format was already popular on what passed for the Internet in those
    days (remember, the World Wide Web didn't even exist until 1991) due to its small
    file size, lossless compression, and wide support. The enhanced version which
    allowed animations that anyone could create themselves, provided they had supporting
    software, quickly became popular.

- en: In addition to animated GIFs, browser vendors added support for proprietary
    HTML elements that handled animation natively, such as the `<blink>` and `<marquee>`
    elements, which added different animated effects to text.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Neither of these elements was particularly attractive or successful, and the
    W3C, as well as leading industry accessibility and usability experts advised against
    their use in most cases. Different browsers at that time supported one or the
    other of these elements, but not both. Both elements were added by their respective
    vendors as part of the original browser wars.

- en: In the late 1990s, popular browsers added support for a technique known as **Dynamic
    HTML** (**DHTML**), which allowed scripting languages to modify the contents of
    a page after the page had loaded. DHTML wasn't any single technology, but rather
    a collection of techniques (JavaScript, CSS, DOM, and so on) that worked together
    to enable a basic level of interactivity and/or animation.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, DHTML made it possible to create quite advanced animations, but restrictions
    in the early implementations of the required technologies, as well as hugely varying
    browser support made DHTML tricky at best.

- en: This era also saw the release and the rise of Flash (and Shockwave, a competing
    technology that was eventually subsumed by Macromedia—which was later acquired
    by Adobe in 2005), a vector and raster graphics format that allowed audio and
    video streaming, frame-by-frame animation, and a host of other features. Flash
    quickly became popular, and at the time of writing is still the number one format
    for web-based video, browser-based gaming, and advertising.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gradual standardization of the DOM across (most) browsers, as well as the rise
    of JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, which abstracted away the differences
    that remained between browsers, have opened up animation to a much wider range
    of people than ever before. The term DHTML isn't often used these days because
    of its connotations with poor support between browsers, but the underlying principles
    and techniques that drive many interactive and animated sites remain similar.

- en: Today, in addition to the animations made plausible and accessible by JavaScript
    libraries, we have much newer and much more exciting possibilities with CSS3 and
    native HTML elements such as the `<canvas>` element, which provides complete pixel-level
    control over an area of the page. We'll be looking at some CSS3 animation techniques,
    as well as the `<canvas>` element in more detail towards the end of the book.
    Flash-based animation is on the decline for the first time this century, and new
    technologies are poised on the horizon.

    to create a more compelling computing experience. When used in the right way,
    animations provide assistance to the users of the system, to lead and guide them
    through different tasks, provide context or feedback, and reinforce positive actions.

    7 or OS X—the application appears to squish down into the icon on the taskbar/dock,
    which shows the user where to go when they want to return to the application.
    It's the simple details like this that can be most effective.

- en: Good animations can lend an air of sleek professionalism to an interface and
    make it appear more advanced or more modern. Apple's iPhone (or iPad) is a perfect
    example—the seamless use of subtle animations and transitions within the operating
    system and its applications allow the user to connect with the device in a profoundly
    satisfying and immersive way. Anything that appears or disappears is faded smoothly
    in or out, and menus and content panels slide in or out from the top or the sides.
    Sudden events can unsettle or distract users, but a well-timed animation can help
    to make them aware that something is happening or something is about to happen.
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be warned though, badly executed, clumsy, or overly pointless animations can
    do the opposite, making your interface appear basic, poorly designed, or inferior.
    No animation can be better than poor animation. Even if your application works
    perfectly, superfluous animations can leave your users feeling frustrated and
    cause them to forgo your application or website.

    are easily powerful enough to handle quite complex animations, and with integrated

    in the example where we create a jQuery plugin), this is another good habit to

    is being added to the page for example, and then hide it again once the operation
    is complete.

    a new `<div>` element as a container for the loader, using an **object literal**
    as the second argument in the anonymous function to give it an `id` of `loader`.
    We then set its style to `display:none` with jQuery's `css()` method so that it
    is not immediately visible.

    create the three individual loading bars. We set its opacity to `0.2` (20% opaque)
    using the `css()` method. jQuery normalizes this style for us so that it works
    correctly in Internet Explorer. The last variable, `loadingInterval`, will be
    used to store `id` of an **interval** so that we can clear the interval when we
    need to. We set this to null initially, as the interval has not yet been set.

    `for` loop, with just three iterations. Within this loop, we clone the span element
    we created, give it a class name (so that each bar can be styled separately),
    and then append it to the container. Once the three loading bars have been added
    to the container, we insert the loader after the `<button>` element.
  id: totrans-198
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we define a function called `runLoader`. This is the function that will
    be repeatedly called by the interval. The function doesn't run until the button
    is clicked. Within this function, we cache the selector for each of the three
    individual bars and then run a series of nested functions.
  id: totrans-199

- en: We first increased the first-loading bar to full opacity using the `fadeTo()`
    jQuery animation method. This method takes a string indicating the speed of the
    animation as its first argument (in milliseconds, or using strings `"fast"` or
    `"slow"`), the opacity that the element should be faded to as its second argument
    (values range from 0-1, including decimals such as 0.50), and a callback function
    as the third argument. The callback function is executed as soon as the animation
    ends.
  id: totrans-200
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the callback function, we then fade the first loading bar back to its original
    opacity of `0.2`. We supply another callback function to this method call, and
    within this callback function we animate the second loading bar to full opacity
    and then back to its original opacity. The same process is repeated for the third
    loading bar.
  id: totrans-201
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we use the jQuery `click()` method to add two functions which will
    be executed alternately each time the button is clicked. We'll use an `if` statement
    to check whether our `#loader` element is visible on the page by using `.is(":visible")`
    and adding an exclamation point (`!`) so that it returns true if the `#loader`
    element is not visible. If it isn't visible, we'll show the loader and then set
    the interval that repeatedly calls the `runLoader()` function. If the element
    is already visible, we hide the loader and clear the interval.

    just before making the request, and hiding it again once the response has been
    processed. The JSONP example, which retrieves images of cats, on the jQuery website
    ([http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON)),
    makes a great test case. Depending on the speed of your connection, the loader
    may not be visible for very long.
