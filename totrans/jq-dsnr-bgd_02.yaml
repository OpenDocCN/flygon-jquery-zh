    humble link is the thing that revolutionized documents and made the Web as we
    know it today possible. Being able to link a reader directly to another document
    or to another place within a document had never been possible before.

    bit controversial. Some argue that the site visitors themselves should decide
    if they want to open a link in a new window, and many browsers make it easy for
    them to do just that. Some argue that opening a link in a new window breaks the
    expected behavior of the **Back** button and should be avoided. Others argue that
    not opening links in a new window is confusing and disorienting for the site visitors
    when they suddenly find themselves on a different website.

    we want with jQuery and will also make it easier for us to style our tabs with

    used to select the hover, visited, and active states of links (`a:hover, a:visited`,
    and `a:active`). jQuery makes a few additional `pseudoclass` selectors available
    to us there are pseudoclass selectors for buttons, empty elements, disabled form
    fields, checkboxes, and more. You can check out all the available selectors for
    jQuery in the jQuery documentation at [http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).
    Here, we're using the `:visible` pseudoclass to select the `.tab-section` that's
    currently visible. Once we've selected the visible .tab-section, we hide it and
    then find the correct `tab-section` and show it.
