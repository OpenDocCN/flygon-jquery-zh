    There are some common elements in this area such as a logo, a login, navigation
    options, a sign-up option, and a search field. But planning this area is not too
    easy because if we put all the elements together, we will give our users a messy
    navigation. Another option is to reserve a lot of space for our header, but it
    will probably hide more content above the fold on smartphones. The expected result
    is to occupy a small amount of space for your header and to handle that space
    efficiently in order to display those elements.

    correct situation to use each one in a clear and intuitive way, and to avoid frustrating
    users. That's why crafting our navigation menu in a way that will allow users
    to easily and clearly see the main and sub-items in it is important to us.

    which items they want to see. However, for specific topics, the top navigation
