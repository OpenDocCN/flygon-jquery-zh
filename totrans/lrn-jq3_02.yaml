    elements in the DOM easy. The DOM serves as the interface between JavaScript and
    a web page; it provides a representation of the source HTML as a network of objects
    rather than as plain text.

    to being the ancestor of `<head>` and `<body>`, `<html>` is also their parent.

    represented by a jQuery object. These objects are very easy to work with when
    we want to actually do something with the things that we find on a page. We can
    easily bind events to these objects and add visual effects to them, as well as
    chain multiple modifications or effects together.

    the DOM elements that are collected within a jQuery object.
  prefs: []

- en: In order to create a new jQuery object, we use the `$()` function. This function
    typically accepts a CSS selector as its sole parameter and serves as a factory,
    returning a new jQuery object pointing to the corresponding elements on the page.
    Just about anything that can be used in a stylesheet can also be passed as a string
    to this function, allowing us to apply jQuery methods to the matched set of elements.

    `$()` function is very common in JavaScript libraries, conflicts could arise if
    more than one of these libraries were being used in a given page. We can avoid
    such conflicts by replacing every instance of `$` with `jQuery` in our custom
    jQuery code. Additional solutions to this problem are addressed in [Chapter 10](d150ca06-e7dc-4100-8c91-060f0272ff67.xhtml),

    text inputs with `$('input[type="password"], input[type="text"]:disabled')`. Even

    this were the only way to select elements, our options would be somewhat limited.
    There are many occasions when selecting a parent or ancestor element is essential;
    that is where jQuery's DOM traversal methods come into play. With these methods,
    we can go up, down, and all around the DOM tree with ease.

    how to apply different styles to different types of links using attribute selectors,
    add rudimentary striping to a table using either the custom jQuery selectors `:odd`
    and `:even` or the advanced CSS selector `:nth-child()`, and highlight text within
    certain table cells by chaining jQuery methods.
