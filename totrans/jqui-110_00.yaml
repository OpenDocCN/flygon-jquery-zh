- en: Modern web application user interface design requires rapid development and
    proven results. jQuery UI, a trusted suite of official plugins for the jQuery
    JavaScript library, gives you a solid platform on which you can build rich and
    engaging interfaces with maximum compatibility, stability, and minimum time and
    effort.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: jQuery UI has a series of ready-made, great-looking user interface widgets and
    a comprehensive set of core interaction helpers designed to be implemented in
    a consistent and developer-friendly way. With all this, the amount of code that
    you need to write personally to take a project from conception to completion is
    drastically reduced.

- en: Specially revised for Version 1.10 of jQuery UI, this book has been written
    to maximize your experience with the library by breaking down each component and
    walking you through examples that progressively build upon your knowledge, taking
    you from beginner to advanced usage in a series of easy-to-follow steps.

- en: In this book, you'll learn how each component can be initialized in a basic
    default implementation and then see how easy it is to customize its appearance
    and configure its behavior to tailor it to the requirements of your application.
    You'll look at the configuration options and the methods exposed by each component's
    API to see how these can be used to bring out the best in the library.

- en: Events play a key role in any modern web application if it is to meet the expected
    minimum requirements of interactivity and responsiveness. Each chapter will show
    you the custom events fired by the component covered and how these events can
    be intercepted and acted upon.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introducing jQuery UI"), *Introducing jQuery
    UI*, lets you find out exactly what the library is, where it can be downloaded
    from, and how the files within it are structured. We also look at ThemeRoller,
    which browsers support the library, how it is licensed, and how the API has been
    simplified to give the components a consistent and easy-to-use programming model.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The CSS Framework and Other Utilities"),
    *The CSS Framework and Other Utilities*, looks in detail at the extensive CSS
    framework, which provides a rich environment for integrated theming through Themeroller
    and also allows developers to easily supply their own custom themes or skins.
    We also cover the new position utility and have a look at all the unique features
    and series of configuration options that it provides.'

    Widget*, looks at the first widget, which is the tabs widget, a simple but effective
    means of presenting structured content in an engaging and interactive widget.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. The Accordion Widget"), *The Accordion Widget*,
    looks at the accordion widget, another component dedicated to the effective display
    of content. Highly engaging and interactive, the accordion makes a valuable addition
    to any web page and its API is exposed in full to show exactly how it can be used.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. The Dialog"), *The Dialog*, focuses on the
    dialog widget. The dialog behaves in the same way as a standard browser alert,
    but it does so in a much less intrusive and more visitor-friendly manner. We look
    at how it can be configured and controlled to provide maximum benefit and appeal.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. The Slider and Progressbar Widgets"), *The
    Slider and Progressbar Widgets*, provides a less commonly used, but no less valuable
    user interface tool for collecting input from your visitors, and displaying the
    results of an action to them. We look closely at the APIs of both components throughout
    this chapter to see the variety of ways in which it can be implemented, and put
    to good use in our web applications.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. The Datepicker Widget"), *The Datepicker
    Widget*, looks at the datepicker. This component packs a huge amount of functionality
    into an attractive and highly usable tool, allowing your visitors to effortlessly
    select dates. We look at the wide range of configurations that its API makes possible
    as well as seeing how easy common tasks such as skinning and localization are
    made.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. The Button and Autocomplete Widgets"), *The
    Button and Autocomplete Widgets*, looks at the brand new button, and recently
    revived autocomplete. Long-time users of the library will remember the autocomplete
    from a previous version of the library. The widget is now back, fully updated
    to fit in with the latest version of the library and in this chapter we get to
    see how it can be used to great effect.'

    us through how to create and add menus to our websites or application. We''ll
    see how, with minimal code, we can turn a bunch of ordinary hyperlinks into an
    interactive system for navigating around your site, which will help engage your
    site''s visitors and make it easy to find content.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Working with Tooltips"), *Working with
    Tooltips*, will show us how, with minimal effort, we can easily provide a context-based
    system of support, by displaying important messages or feedback to the end user.
    This is particularly important in instances where visitors to your site may have
    inadvertently entered incorrect information; we can help get them back onto the
    right track!'

    to look at the low-level interaction helpers, tackling first the related drag-and-droppable
    components. We look at how they can be implemented individually and how they can
    be used together to enhance your user interfaces.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. The Resizable Component"), *The Resizable
    Component*, looks at the resizing component and how it is used with the dialog
    widget seen earlier in the book. We see how it can be applied to any element on
    the page to allow it to be resized in a smooth and attractive way.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Selecting and Sorting with jQuery UI"),
    *Selecting and Sorting with jQuery UI*, looks at the final two interaction helpers
    in this chapter; the selectable and sortable components. We can use the components
    to select and sort elements in a website or application, although the sortable
    component really comes into its own when working with lists, as you can reorder
    them by dragging items to a new position in the list. Both components can help
    you add a high level of professionalism and interactivity to your site, while
    at the same time blurring the boundaries between desktop and browser-based applications.'

    solely to the special effects that are included with the library. We look at an
    array of different effects that allow you to show, hide, move, and jiggle elements
    in a variety of attractive and appealing animations.'

    an extensive look at the widget factory and how it allows us to quickly and easily
    create our very own jQuery UI plugins. The widget factory solves lots of common
    problems for you and can greatly improve productivity; it also extensively improves
    code reuse, making it a great fit for jQuery UI as well as many other stateful
    plugins. You can find this chapter at [http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2209OS_Chapter_15.pdf](http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2209OS_Chapter_15.pdf).'
