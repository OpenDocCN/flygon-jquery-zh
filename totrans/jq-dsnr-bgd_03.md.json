Your answers could take up an entire screen or more all on their own - it doesn't matter since the answer will be hidden until the user wants to see it.</p>\n    </dd>\n    <dt>What if a user doesn't have JavaScript enabled?</dt>\n    <dd>\n    <p>You have two options for users with JavaScript disabled - which you choose might depend on the content of your page.</p>\n    <p>You might just leave the page as it is - and make sure the &lt;dt&gt; tags are styled in a way that makes them stand out and easy to pick up when you're scanning down through the page. This would be a great solution if your answers are relatively short.</p>\n    <p>If your FAQ page has long answers, it might be helpful to put a table of contents list of links to individual questions at the top of the page so users can click it to jump directly to the question and answer they're interested in. This is similar to what we did in the tabbed example, but in this case, we would use jQuery to hide the table of contents when the page loaded since users with JavaScript wouldn't need to see the table of contents.</p>\n    </dd>\n    </dl>\n\n    ```", "```js\n    function dynamicFaq() {\n    //our FAQ code will go here\n    }\n\n    ```", "```js\n    function dynamicFaq() {\n    $('dd').hide();\n    }\n\n    ```", "```js\n    function dynamicFaq() {\n    $('dd').hide();\n    $('dt').bind('click', function(){\n    //Show function will go here\n    });\n    }\n\n    ```", "```js\n    <dl>\n    <dt>Question 1</dt>\n    <dd>Answer to Question 1</dd>\n    <dt>Question 2</dt>\n    <dd>Answer to Question 2</dd>\n    ...\n    </dl>\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $('dt').bind('click', function(){\n    $(this);\n    });\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $('dt').bind('click', function(){\n    $(this).next();\n    });\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $('dt').bind('click', function(){\n    $(this).next().show();\n    });\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $(document).ready(function(){\n    dynamicFaq();\n    });\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $('dt').bind('click', function(){\n    $(this).next().toggle();\n    });\n\n    ```", "```js\n    dt {\n    color: #268bd2;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    margin: 0 0 1em 0;\n    }\n    dt:hover {\n    color: #2aa198;\n    }\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $('dt').bind('click', function(){\n    $(this).next().slideToggle();\n    });\n\n    ```", "```js\n    dt {\n    color: #268bd2;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    margin: 0 0 1em 0;\n    padding: 0 0 0 20px;\n    background: url(../images/arrow.png) 0 0 no-repeat;\n    line-height: 16px;\n    }\n    dt:hover {\n    color: #2aa198;\n    background-position: 0 -32px;\n    }\n\n    ```", "```js\n    dt.open {\n    background-position: 0 -64px;\n    }\n    dt.open:hover {\n    background-position: 0 -96px;\n    }\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $('dt').bind('click', function(){\n    $(this).toggleClass('open');\n    $(this).next().slideToggle();\n    });\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $(this).next().slideToggle();\n\n    ```", "```js\n    $(this).toggleClass('open').next().slideToggle();\n\n    ```"]
