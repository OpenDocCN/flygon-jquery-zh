  prefs: []

    plugin too) should be added to the `<head>` tag, although there are valid arguments

    the `<head>` tag is necessary and this choice should be left to the developer's
    requirements. My personal preference is to place it in the `<head>` tag as it
    provides a clean separation of the script (and the CSS) code from the main markup
    in the body of the page, particularly on lighter sites.
  prefs: []

    if jQuery is added at the top, rather than at the bottom; some systems, such as
    WordPress, include jQuery in the `<head>` section too, so either will work. The
    key here though is if you are perceiving slowness, then move your scripts to just
    before the `<body>` tag, which is considered a better practice.
