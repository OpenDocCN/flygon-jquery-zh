- en: Creating user experiences that excite users is a fun and rewarding job. You're
    essentially improving the lives of many people. Most UI developers have their
    eye on the finish line, seeing their product put to use. The faster we get to
    that finish line without sacrificing quality, the better. The tools we use to
    help get us there can make all the difference in the world.

- en: Part of what makes the jQuery Framework so popular among developers, the "write
    less, do more" mantra, materializes in jQuery UI as well. The modern versions
    of HTML and CSS standards have the tools required for assembling a robust, responsive
    user interface. Where this idea falls apart—browser inconsistencies and lack of
    development conventions and patterns across projects—jQuery UI steps in. The goal
    of jQuery UI isn't to reinvent the way we write web applications, but rather,
    to fill in gaps and progressively enhance existing browser components.

- en: Like any framework, jQuery UI isn't for everyone, nor is it perfect for those
    that do use it. The framework embraces this fact, and provides extensibility mechanisms
    for most situations you might find yourself in. My goal with this book is to share
    with you some experiences I've had with jQuery UI widgets. I've extended where
    possible, and hacked where necessary. I'm sure you'll find the majority of the
    recipes in this book useful, no matter what kind of application you're building.

- en: This book is for the jQuery UI developer looking to improve their existing applications,
    extract ideas for their new application, or to better understand the overall widget
    architecture. The reader should at least have a rudimentary understanding of what
    jQuery UI is, and have written some code that uses jQuery UI. The recipes in this
    book are targeted at the intermediate jQuery UI developer. Depending on your needs,
    each recipe is self-contained enough to be useful on its own, but connected enough
    to guide you to others.
