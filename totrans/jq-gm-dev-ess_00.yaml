  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the advantages of working with web technologies is that you won't need
    any complex or costly software to get you started. For strictly client-side games,
    you will only need your favorite code editor (or even a simple text editor, if
    you don't mind working without any syntax highlighting). If you haven't chosen
    any yet, there is plenty of free software around you that you could try, ranging
    from very old-school, such as VIM ([http://www.vim.org/](http://www.vim.org/))
    and Emacs ([http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/))
    to more modern, such as Eclipse ([http://www.eclipse.org/](http://www.eclipse.org/))
    and Aptana ([http://www.aptana.com/](http://www.aptana.com/)), Notepad++ ([http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)),
    or Komodo Edit ([http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit)).
    These are only some of the available editors that you can find. For JavaScript,
    you don't need a very advanced editor, so just use the one you're more familiar
    with.

    Here again, you will have a lot of choice. The most famous open source software
    being Gimp ([http://www.gimp.org/](http://www.gimp.org/)) and one of my personal
    favorites, Pixen ([http://pixenapp.com/](http://pixenapp.com/)).

    and MySQL. If you don't already have a server that supports them, to install these
    on your machine, you can use MAMP ([http://www.mamp.info/](http://www.mamp.info/)),
    XAMPP ([http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)),
    or EasyPHP ([http://www.easyphp.org/](http://www.easyphp.org/)) depending upon
    your OS.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary audience for this book is a beginner web developer with some experience
    in JavaScript and jQuery. Since the server-side part is implemented in PHP, it
    will help if you have some knowledge of it too, but if you're more comfortable
    with another server-side language, you could use it instead of PHP without too
    much trouble.
